	abstract = {RNA-Seq data is inherently nonuniform for different transcripts because of differences in gene expression. This makes it challenging to decide how much data should be generated from each sample. How much should one spend to recover the less expressed transcripts? The sequencing technology used is another consideration, as there are inevitably always biases against certain sequences. To investigate these effects, we first looked at high-depth libraries from a set of well-annotated organisms to ascertain the impact of sequencing depth on de novo assembly. We then looked at libraries sequenced from the Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) to compare the performance of Illumina HiSeq and MGI DNBseq™ technologies.},

            Whole genome sequencing (WGS) shows promise as a first-tier diagnostic test for patients with rare genetic disorders. However, standards addressing the definition and deployment practice of a best-in-class test are lacking. To address these gaps, the Medical Genome Initiative, a consortium of leading health care and research organizations in the US and Canada, was formed to expand access to high quality clinical WGS by convening experts and publishing best practices. Here, we present best practice recommendations for the interpretation and reporting of clinical diagnostic WGS, including discussion of challenges and emerging approaches that will be critical to harness the full potential of this comprehensive test.},

              Background
              DNBSEQ-T7 is a new whole-genome sequencer developed by Complete Genomics and MGI using DNA nanoball and combinatorial probe anchor synthesis technologies to generate short reads at a very large scale—up to 60 human genomes per day. However, it has not been objectively and systematically compared against Illumina short-read sequencers.
            
            
              Findings
              By using the same KOREF sample, the Korean Reference Genome, we have compared 7 sequencing platforms including BGISEQ-500, DNBSEQ-T7, HiSeq2000, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000, HiSeqX10, and NovaSeq6000. We measured sequencing quality by comparing sequencing statistics (base quality, duplication rate, and random error rate), mapping statistics (mapping rate, depth distribution, and percent GC coverage), and variant statistics (transition/transversion ratio, dbSNP annotation rate, and concordance rate with single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] genotyping chip) across the 7 sequencing platforms. We found that MGI platforms showed a higher concordance rate for SNP genotyping than HiSeq2000 and HiSeq4000. The similarity matrix of variant calls confirmed that the 2 MGI platforms have the most similar characteristics to the HiSeq2500 platform.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Overall, MGI and Illumina sequencing platforms showed comparable levels of sequencing quality, uniformity of coverage, percent GC coverage, and variant accuracy; thus we conclude that the MGI platforms can be used for a wide range of genomics research fields at a lower cost than the Illumina platforms.},

	abstract = {With the developments in DNA nanoball sequencing technologies and the emergence of new platforms, there is an increasing interest in their performance in comparison with the widely used sequencing-by-synthesis methods. Here, we test the consistency of metabarcoding results from DNBSEQ-G400RS (DNA nanoball sequencing platform by MGI-Tech) and NovaSeq 6000 (sequencing-by-synthesis platform by Illumina) platforms using technical replicates of DNA libraries that consist of COI gene amplicons from 120 soil DNA samples. By subjecting raw sequencing data from both platforms to a uniform bioinformatics processing, we found that the proportion of high-quality reads passing through the filtering steps was similar in both datasets. Per-sample operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness patterns were highly correlated, but sequencing data from DNBSEQ-G400RS harbored a higher number of OTUs. This may be related to the lower dominance of most common OTUs in DNBSEQ data set (thus revealing higher richness by detecting rare taxa) and/or to a lower effective read quality leading to generation of spurious OTUs. However, there was no statistical difference in the ASV and post-clustered ASV richness between platforms, suggesting that additional denoising step in the ASV workflow had effectively removed the ‘noisy’ reads. Both OTU-based and ASV-based composition were strongly correlated between the sequencing platforms, with essentially interchangeable results. Therefore, we conclude that DNBSEQ-G400RS and NovaSeq 6000 are both equally efficient high-throughput sequencing platforms to be utilized in studies aiming to apply the metabarcoding approach, but the main benefit of the former is related to lower sequencing cost.},

          Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) on DNA nanoarrays provides billions of reads at relatively low cost and enables a multitude of genomic applications. Further improvement in read length, sequence quality and cost reduction will enable more affordable and accurate comprehensive health monitoring tests. Currently the most efficient MPS uses dye-labeled reversibly terminated nucleotides (RTs) that are expensive to make and challenging to incorporate. Furthermore, a part of the dye-linker (scar) remains on the nucleobase after cleavage and interferes with subsequent sequencing cycles. We describe here the development of a novel MPS chemistry (CoolMPS™) utilizing unlabeled RTs and four natural nucleobase-specific fluorescently labeled antibodies with fast (30 sec) binding. We implemented CoolMPS™ on MGI’s PCR-free DNBSEQ MPS platform using arrays of 200nm DNA nanoballs (DNBs) generated by rolling circle replication and demonstrate 3-fold improvement in signal intensity and elimination of scar interference. Single-end 100-400 base and pair-end 2×150 base reads with high quality were readily generated with low out-of-phase incorporation. Furthermore, DNBs with less than 50 template copies were successfully sequenced by strong-signal CoolMPS™ with 3-times higher accuracy than in standard MPS. CoolMPS™ chemistry based on natural nucleobases has potential to provide longer, more accurate and less expensive MPS reads, including highly accurate “4-color sequencing” on the most efficient dye-crosstalk-free 2-color imagers with an estimated sequencing error rate of 0.00058\% (one error in 170,000 base calls) in a proof-of-concept demonstration.},
